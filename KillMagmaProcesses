ps -eafww //ps reports a snapshot of the current processes
          //e selects all processes
          //a selects all except both session leaders and non-terminal associated processes
          //f does full format listing
          //w does wide output, a second w provides unlimited width
//Some of those options may not be the best ones to use

grep USERNAME  //Filters for only the lines with the provided username
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
grep magma.exe //Only some of the processes (the ones I actually wanted to kill) had .exe
               //So filtering for those gives me the data that I actually want
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
awk '{print $2}' //The process ids were in the second column, awk makes it easy to output
                 // just the second column of input
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
xargs kill  //xargs takes whatever you're piping in and supplies that as arguments to your
            //specified process. In this case, I want to send the process ids to kill
            //so that those processes will be killed

Final command:
ps -eafww | grep USERNAME | grep magma.exe | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill
