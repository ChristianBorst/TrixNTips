Record repetitive tasks:
Vim enables recording by pressing:
  1) q -To signal to begin recording mode
  2) Any alphanumeric character - This character is what you will refer to the recorded commands with
  3) A sequence of commands you wish to repeat
  4) 1 -To signal to end recording mode
In order to replay your recorded task, you simply press:
  1) @ -To signal that you wish to replay a saved task
  2) An alphanumeric character you previously recorded tasks with.

Example:
  Full recording command: qbwwwdwj0q
  Full replay command:    @b
  These commands save into the "register" 'b'.
  Pressing @b will have vim skip three words, delete a word, then go to the beginning of the next line.
